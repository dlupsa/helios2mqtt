> A deamon for syncing a helios easy controls system like my KWL EC 220D to mqtt following the [mqtt-smarthome](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome) architecure.

Based on the idea of [mqtt-smarthome](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome) and especially on the work of hobbyquaker [hm2mqtt.js](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/hm2mqtt.js) I decided to build a bridge for my helios KWL system to mqtt.

Set is now implemented but without any checks. The published value will be written as it is.

Please read the --help output for commandline options. I tried to stick as close as possible to hm2mqtt.js.

## History

I bumped the version from 0.0.x to 0.1.x since there were now problems reported on github and there none on my own installation in the past years.

New in 0.1.8:
* get and set commands via mqtt are now higher priority than internal timed reads to get faster responses esp. during startup where many reads are queued.

New in 0.1.7:
* updated this readme

New in 0.1.6:
* corrected help text (default for watchdog)
* integrated new variable bypass_offen (thanks to hhansen06 on github).
* updated dependencies since there were security issues (see releasenotes on github)

The versions 0.1.0 to 0.1.5 were internal relases which were broken and so I removed them here instantly.

## Install

`sudo npm install -g helios2mqtt`

As hobbyquaker I also suggest to use pm2 to manage the hm2mqtt process (start on system boot, manage log files, ...). There is a really good howto at the [mqtt-smarthome repo](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome/blob/master/howtos/homematic.md)

```
### Customization

If you would like to change the variables which are read from the helios modbus tcp interface have a look at the file helios_vars.json file (if you installed using above npm install -g you will find it at /usr/lib/node_modules/helios2mqtt/helios_vars.json). If someone can tell me how to make that file "user customizable" in an more elegant way instead of -j option, e.g. in user's home directory please send me an email!

### Examples

* Simple Example, local mqtt server, no auth:
`/usr/bin/helios2mqtt -a 192.168.4.30`
starts the deamon, connects to helios modbus KWL at `192.168.4.30` and publishes at `helios/status/#` of the local mqtt (port 1883)

* Complex Example, local mqtt server, with auth:
`/usr/bin/helios2mqtt -a 192.168.4.30 -b 502 -m mqtt://192.168.4.10 -u heliosMqtt -p seCRe7 -v warn -n helios220D -s -j /home/smarthome/helios_vars.json`
starts the deamon, connects to helios modbus KWL at `192.168.4.30` and publishes at `helios/status/#` of the mqtt server at `192.168.4.10` using the credentials above. Published will be json strings with additional infos. Will only print warning and errors. Uses a customized version of the variables definition in home of smarthome user.

### mqtt topics

* `helios/status/xxx`:
helios2mqtt pushes all the readings from helios KWL to one subtopic each. You can choose using -s Option if you would like to simply have the value or a json string with more info like timestamp and explanation.

* `helios/get/xxx`:
helios2mqtt listens to get requests here. You can request status updates for specific readings here. The response will be published as status.

* `helios/connected`:
    * `0` means not connected (using a mqtt will, so this means deamon is not running at all or is not able to connect to mqtt server)
    * `1` means connected to mqtt but no connection to helios
    * `2` means connected to both, mqtt and helios KWL

* `helios/set/xxx`:
Can be used for changing variables in helios KWL. Set is now implemented but without any checks. The published value will be written as it is. Please read [Helios easyControls Modbus Gateway TCP/IP](https://www.heliosventilatoren.de/mbv/kwl_modbus_easycontrols_82269-001_0917.pdf) for the correct format and/or use the information in helios_Vers.json.

### watchdog feature

The watchdog monitors mqtt-publish activity of helios2mqtt. I suggest using at least 60 seconds. You can turn this on in order to let helios2mqtt exit as a last measure if all reconnect attempts fail (i.e. twice the watchdog time went by without any successful publish. Reasons could for exmaple be a problem with modbus connection to helios and no data from helios or a connection problem to mqtt server. Use witch care - you have to make sure the process gets restarted after it exits, e.g. using pm2 or similar.

### FHEM integration

Based on this deamon it's easy to add your Helios easycontrols modbus tcp device to FHEM:

1. Define a MQTT IODev and set everything up, see FHEM Wiki: https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/MQTT_Einf%C3%BChrung.
2. Add a MQTT_DEVICE:
```
define helios MQTT_DEVICE
attr helios retain 0
attr helios qos 0
attr helios autoSubscribeReadings helios/status/+
attr helios subscribeReading_connected helios/connected
```

## systemctl configuration

### Create a systemctl configuration file for helios2mqtt
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/zigbee2mqtt.service

```
